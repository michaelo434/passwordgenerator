#<Password Generator>

##Description

-Motivation: to practice all the knowledge I've obtained and to understand why I'm lacking.
-Built this project to better improve myself and familiarize myself to all the new concepts I've learned.
-During this project, there were many troubleshooting issues. A few of them took hours to have fixed; I learned that simple things can become extremely complicated and that syntax errors cause big problems.

### Features
The features of the project will have the following:

-An index.html providing the webpage and having the password generator. 

-A style.css to help "style" the index.html. Primarily designing the password generator.

A script.js to give the index.html or the password generator to be functional in which it is supposed to do:

GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Roadmap
-Will be continuing to modify the page
  primarily "cleaning" and "organizing" the script.js to be more readable.

## Project Status
-Status: Busy (Needs to be updated)
